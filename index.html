    <h1>GET YOUR DOLLARS, GIRL</h1>
    <h2>Interactive Storytelling Project</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to <i>Get Your Dollars, Girl</i> - a 3-part interactive media project on labor conditions of drag artists in NYC. Due to power imbalances and a lack
        of structure in the NYC drag scene, conversations about the work conditions of nightlife performers aren't held often enough. The goal of <i>Get Your Dollars, Girl</i>
        is to raise public awareness of the struggles drag artists face, and spur conversations about how unfair such a booming industry can be towards those
        at its very core.
