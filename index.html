    <h1>GET YOUR DOLLARS, GIRL</h1>
    <h2>An analysis of labor and wages in NYC’s Queer Nightlife</h2>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>Welcome to Get Your Dollars, Girl - an interactive storytelling project on labor conditions of drag artists in NYC.<br/><br/>
        Due to power imbalances and a lack of structure in the NYC drag scene, conversations about the labor conditions of nightlife<br/><br/>
        performers aren't held often enough. The goal of Get Your Dollars, Girl is to raise public awareness of the struggles drag<br/><br/>
        artists face, and spur conversations about how unfair such a booming industry can be towards those at its very foundation.
