    <h2>Progress Report</h2>
    
    <p>
        <b>03/08:</b> Work on interviews for the interactive documentary (Eko) in progress. 1 performer interview done,
        2 scheduled. Working on ideas for two other tools.<br/><br/>
        <b>04/02:</b> Interviews with 3 performers have been conducted, more in progress. 1/4 animated scenes is finished,
        start screen in progress. OTHER EXPERIENCES: Planning in progress.<br/><br/>
        <b>04/19:</b> Three parts of the project identified: <b>DOCUMENTARY</b> (Eko), <b>TIMELINE</b> (Timeline), <b>MAP</b> (StoryMap).
        MAP/TIMELINE: Research done into the history of drag and current performance locations in NYC, collected information and media.

        <b>04/30, Final week of filming: </b>  We ran into multiple challenges as far as rounding up performers that we have scoured to get some of the final touches for filming. We decided to follow group-member Brooklyn Bridges to film an entire session of getting ready from start to finish. During this process, we filmed for approximately 4 hours to capture the process of preparation, makeup, hair, and calling transportation before a show. In this, we wanted to show what it was like to be on a time crunch. It is important to remember that we found that often performers are not paid for their time in these hours getting ready for a show. While a performance may pay for the hours at a bar, the time to get ready is not calculated into this payment. Thus, performers are heavily reliant on tips. For this journey, Brooklyn Bridges spent 4 hours getting ready and was at the bar for 3 hours to perform a “tip spot.” A tip spot is a non-paid performance, usually a competition, in which the only payment comes from audience tips. After getting ready on camera Brooklyn made a total of $30. <br/><br/>
            
            <b>Map curation:</b>  We wanted to show how pervasive drag performance is in NYC, so we created an interactive tool that listed locations around the city that host drag shows. This list, of course, only shows a fraction of the places that have drag but begins to tell one story: that every borough has multiple places for performers to travel to our make money. However, sometimes the ones that make the most money may be difficult to reach for performers. 
            
            In one video example, we followed Lana Del Trey as she went to perform at C’mon Everybody BK. Lana Del Trey took the train in drag from where she lives in Hell’s Kitchen, to film a brief introduction in Hunter’s apartment in Bedstuy. From here, she walked to the club to save money. <br/><br/>
            
            <b>Safety implications:</b> Safety is a luxury for drag performers. It is more expensive to take the safe route home. Brooklyn Bridges: “I can expect to lose a big chunk of my income, or even go into the negative range if I wanted to take the safe route to a show. To me, the only way to be safe is to take a cab or an Uber. I have had scary experiences on the train. I know many queens who have been harassed or assaulted or worse. Therefore, I’m willing to lose a lot of my income to avoid this. My highest paying show ever was a drag brunch uptown somewhere on Broadway. I made over $600 that day but lost about 25% of the pay due to travel expenses because I refuse to step on the subway in drag anymore. This is also never taken into account like it would be for a corporate job.”
