    <h2>Progress Report</h2>
    
    <p>
        The report provides an overview of the progress made on the interactive documentary project that aims to showcase the drag performance scene in New York City. The project is divided into three parts: the documentary (Eko), the timeline (Timeline), and the map (StoryMap). The team has conducted interviews with several performers, with three interviews completed and more in progress. The team has also made progress in creating the animated scenes, start screen, and planning for other experiences.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>03/08:</b> Work on interviews for the interactive documentary (Eko) in progress. 1 performer interview done,
        2 scheduled. Working on ideas for two other tools.<br/><br/>
        Lana Del Trey Interview: This interview required a lot of coordination of performer Lana Del Trey before a performance. She had to take 2 trains to Brooklyn to pick up a wig in the same neighborhood she was performing in. We were able to follow her to the club as she talked about her experience with travel and money in drag. Hunter filmed the footage and scripted the questions while Katya inserted the split clips into the Eko interactive tool. This was the first clip we were able to integrate into the project. Bolor later on added the nightclub that LDT was performing at to the interactive map that was another tool at the end. 
        <br/><br/>
        <b>04/02:</b> Interviews with 3 performers have been conducted, more in progress. 1/4 animated scenes is finished,
        start screen in progress. OTHER EXPERIENCES: Planning in progress.<br/><br/>
        <b>Spring break:</b> Conducted a Zoom interview with performer, QueenE, that lasted approximately 20 minutes. Conducted a Zoom interview with Zorra. <br/><br/>

        <b>04/19:</b> Three parts of the project identified: <b>DOCUMENTARY</b> (Eko), <b>TIMELINE</b> (Timeline), <b>MAP</b> (StoryMap).
        MAP/TIMELINE: Research done by Bola into the history of drag and current performance locations in NYC, information and media collected.
        <br/><br/>
        For the start screen, we had to make directions more simply and provide an example of clickable buttons. Various items in each screen are highlighted with clickable buttons that carry you to the next screen. These buttons had to balance the line between not obstructive to the sight and aesthetic, but also accessible for viewers to see even with low vision. For accessibility purposes, we also made sure to include closed captions for interviews beyond this point. 
        <br/><br/> <b>04/30, Final week of filming: </b>  We ran into multiple challenges as far as rounding up performers that we have scoured to get some of the final touches for filming. We decided to follow group-member Brooklyn Bridges to film an entire session of getting ready from start to finish. During this process, we filmed for approximately 4 hours to capture the process of preparation, makeup, hair, and calling transportation before a show. In this, we wanted to show what it was like to be on a time crunch. It is important to remember that we found that often performers are not paid for their time in these hours getting ready for a show. While a performance may pay for the hours at a bar, the time to get ready is not calculated into this payment. Thus, performers are heavily reliant on tips. For this journey, Brooklyn Bridges spent 4 hours getting ready and was at the bar for 3 hours to perform a “tip spot.” A tip spot is a non-paid performance, usually a competition, in which the only payment comes from audience tips. After getting ready on camera Brooklyn made a total of $30.

            In Eko, back buttons were added to video clips to let users go back to the choice screen if they, for example, accidentally click on a clip they have already seen.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Map curation:</b>  We wanted to show how pervasive drag performance is in NYC, so we created an interactive tool that listed locations around the city that host drag shows. This list, of course, only shows a fraction of the places that have drag but begins to tell one story: that every borough has multiple places for performers to travel to our make money. However, sometimes the ones that make the most money may be difficult to reach for performers. 
            
            In one video example, we followed Lana Del Trey as she went to perform at C’mon Everybody BK. Lana Del Trey took the train in drag from where she lives in Hell’s Kitchen, to film a brief introduction in Hunter’s apartment in Bedstuy. From here, she walked to the club to save money. <br/><br/>
            
            <b>Safety implications:</b> Safety is a luxury for drag performers. It is more expensive to take the safe route home. Brooklyn Bridges: “I can expect to lose a big chunk of my income, or even go into the negative range if I wanted to take the safe route to a show. To me, the only way to be safe is to take a cab or an Uber. I have had scary experiences on the train. I know many queens who have been harassed or assaulted or worse. Therefore, I’m willing to lose a lot of my income to avoid this. My highest paying show ever was a drag brunch uptown somewhere on Broadway. I made over $600 that day but lost about 25% of the pay due to travel expenses because I refuse to step on the subway in drag anymore. This is also never taken into account like it would be for a corporate job.”  


            <br/><br/> For our third tool, <b>TimeLine,</b> there is a plethora of historical information that was pieced together from various internet sources. There were some historical research difficulties that come natural with drag history because we came to discover that much of this history had been shrouded in secrecy or erased. However, it is there, especially in the city. Also, in earlier history, the was a lot of overlap in terms describing drag queens that made the history unclear. For example, many sources referred to drag queens and transgender women by the same terms. Today, we recognize that transgender women can do drag and drag queens can be transgender women, but there is not always overlap as these are often two distinct identities. 
            
            <br/><br/><b>05/05:</b> We added a new starting screen to Eko with performer introduction clips, some extra videos, and an ending of them talking about their average earnings + credits. The feedback from the presentations was implemented.

            <br/><br/> <i>The nodes of the documentary.</i>
            <br/><br/>  On <b>coding</b> the website: we used contrasting colors that fit the aesthetic of the documentary, we also wanted everything to be in the center so it was easy on the eyes. One of the unexpected challenges were the fonts used for the website that ended up not showing up on anybody's computer, which was fixed.
